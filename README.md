# image-gallery-angular

This is my first project with Angular!

I followed the requirements below:

Your task is to create an application that lists images. The data can either come from local assets/data or
from consuming a real API such as Unsplash or other free image APIs). This is up to your preference.
Requirements

• This is a tab-based application. It needs to have 3 tabs (3 different image categories per your choice).

Every tab consist of the same UI:

• It must contain a grid with tiles that displays the images. It should display 30 images in total.

• Each tile in the grid should have a thumbnail and a title.

• Clicking on an asset should popup a dialog or just enlarge it to fill the current window.

• Be able to close a tab unless it’s the last one.

• The user should be able to filter the images by title or a keyword contained in the title.

• The state of each tab should be preserved, so that the user can switch between tabs without
losing its state.
Please use Angular for the implementation. You should not use any existing component libraries such as Material UI.
