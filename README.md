# ImageGallery

This is my first porject using Angular! :)

For completion, I have ensured that the following requirements have been met:

The app displays a grid of images grouped into categories (animals, nature, activities).
The images are fetched from the Pexels API and displayed in the grid.
Each image is accompanied by its title.
The user can switch between image categories using tabs.
The user can filter images within each category by typing in a search input.
The search filters images based on matching titles or keywords.
Clicking on an image opens a dialog displaying the enlarged image.
The user can close the image dialog.
The app has a responsive layout with appropriate styles for different screen sizes.
The app uses CSS classes and Angular directives to handle events and apply styles dynamically.
